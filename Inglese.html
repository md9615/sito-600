<h2>Introduction</h2>
<img class="img1" src="scientific_revolution.jpg" alt="Scientific Revolution"><br><br>
The <b>Scientific Revolution</b> of the <b>17th century</b> marked a profound transformation in the way humans understood the natural world. 
<br>During the Middle Ages, scientific thought was based on religious dogmas and the writings of ancient philosophers, like <em><b>Aristotle</b></em> and <em><b>Ptolemy</b></em>. Knowledge was often accepted without questioning. <br>In the Renaissance, however, humanism and the rediscovery of classical texts led to new curiosity, observations and methods that challenged these long-standing beliefs about the natural world.<br>
Scientists such as <b>Copernicus</b>,<b> Galileo</b>, <b>Kepler</b>, and <b>Newton</b> introduced revolutionary ideas that emphasized observation, experimentation, and mathematics, laying the foundation for modern science.<br> Their work not only transformed astronomy and physics but also altered the very approach to acquiring knowledge.
<br><br>

<li><div id="copernicus">
<h2>Nicolaus Copernicus (1473–1543)</h2>
<img class="img2" src="copernicus.jpg" alt="Nicolaus Copernicus">
<p><b>Nicolaus Copernicus</b> was a Polish astronomer who revolutionized the understanding of the cosmos by proposing the heliocentric model.<br> Before him, the dominant belief was the geocentric system, which placed the Earth at the center of the universe. In his seminal work, <em><b> De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium (1543)</b></em>, Copernicus argued that the Sun, not the Earth, was the center and that the planets, including Earth, revolved around it. 
<br>Although his theory initially faced skepticism and opposition, it laid the groundwork for the future study of astronomy and challenged centuries of accepted authority.
</div><br><br><p>


<li><div id="galileo">
<h2>Galileo Galilei (1564–1642)</h2>
<img class="img3" src="galileo.jpg" alt="Galileo Galilei">
<p><b>Galileo Galilei</b>, known as the "father of modern science", introduced and improved in 1609 the <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannocchiale"><b>telescope</b></a> and was the first to use it systematically to observe celestial bodies.
<br>With it, he discovered:
<ul>
	<li>The mountains and craters on the Moon</li>
	<li>The four largest moons of Jupiter (Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto)</li>
	<li>The phases of Venus</li>
</ul>
These discoveries provided strong evidence against the Aristotelian idea of perfect, immutable heavens and for the <b>heliocentric theory</b> proposed by <a href="#copernicus">Copernicus</a>.<br>
In 1633, he was tried by the <b>Roman Inquisition</b> and forced to publicly recant his support for heliocentrism. He choosed to abjure rather than resist, mainly due to his advanced age and frail health. <br>Although he spent the remainder of his life under house arrest, he continued to write and reflect, and his groundbreaking ideas laid the foundations for modern physics and the <a href="#method">scientific method</a>.
<p></div><br><br>


<li><div id="method">
<h2>The Scientific Method</h2>
One of the greatest contributions of the Scientific Revolution was the development of the <b>scientific method</b> — a systematic process based on:
<ol>
	<li>Observation</li> 
	<li>Hypothesis</li>
	<li>Experimentation</li>
	<li>Mathematical Analysis</li>
	<li>Conclusion and Universal Laws</li>
</ol>
This method allowed scientists to test theories and base conclusions on real evidence rather than tradition or belief.<br>
Thanks to this new method, science became more objective, reliable, and repeatable. 
<br>It also helped create a new scientific community that shared data and results, leading to collaboration and progress.

<li><div id="kepler">
<h2>Johannes Kepler (1571–1630)</h2>
<img class="img4" src="kepler.jpg" alt="Johannes Kepler">
<p><b>Johannes Kepler</b>, a German mathematician and astronomer, built upon Copernicus’s heliocentric model by introducing new laws of planetary motion. Kepler discovered that planets move in elliptical orbits, not perfect circles as previously thought, and that their speed varies depending on their distance from the Sun. His three laws—describing the shape of orbits, the speed of planets, and the relationship between orbital period and distance—were crucial in advancing the precision and predictive power of astronomy. Kepler’s work helped transform astronomy into a mathematical science and provided key support for Newton’s later theories of gravity.
</div></p><br><br>

<li><div id="newton">
<h2>Isaac Newton (1643–1727)</h2>
<img class="img5" src="newton.jpg" alt="Isaac Newton">
<p><b>Isaac Newton</b>, an English physicist and mathematician, is considered one of the most influential scientists of all time. <br>
His work synthesized the discoveries of his predecessors and created a unified framework for understanding motion and gravity.<br> 
Newton’s <em><b>Principia Mathematica (1687)</b></em> formulated the laws of motion and the universal law of gravitation, explaining how objects attract each other with a force proportional to their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. 
<br>His contributions extended beyond physics to optics and mathematics, where he helped develop calculus. 
<br>Newton’s achievements marked the culmination of the Scientific Revolution, providing the tools and principles that would dominate science for centuries.
